Last Updated: December 8, 2021

This GitHub repository is available as a supplement to my master's thesis at Clemson University, Detecting Partisan Gerrymandering through Mathematical Analysis: A Case Study of South Carolina. It includes all associated code, shapefiles, and data needed to conduct a similar analysis for any state election map.

If there is something specific you are looking for that you do not see in this repo, feel free to email me at avagnoz@clemson.edu.

Changes have been made to the chain code since the completion of my master's thesis project in May 2020. The zipped folder snapshot_thesis_files.zip has the markov chain code files as they existed at the time of my thesis finalization.
