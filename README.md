Last Updated: May 15, 2020

This GitHub repository is available as a supplement to my master's thesis at Clemson University, Detecting Partisan Gerrymandering through Mathematical Analysis: A Case Study of South Carolina. It includes all associated code, shapefiles, and data needed to conduct a similar analysis for any state election map.

If there is something specific you are looking for that you do not see in this repo, feel free to email me at avagnoz@clemson.edu.
