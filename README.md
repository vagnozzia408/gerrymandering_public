Associated files for master's thesis research.

--------------------------- REPOSITORY UNDER CONSTRUCTION ---------------------------

This GitHub repository is available as a supplement to my master's thesis at Clemson University, Detecting Partisan Gerrymandering through Mathematical Analysis: A Case Study of South Carolina. It will include all associated code, shapefiles, and data needed to conduct a similar analysis for any state election map.

This repository is UNDER CONSTRUCTION. I hope to have all files uploaded by May 31, 2020. If there is something specific you are looking for, feel free to email me at avagnoz@clemson.edu.
